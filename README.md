# FactCheckGen
This project uses a combination of APIs and tools to create a system that generates articles, news, and detects fake news.

This project is a Flask-based application that integrates the NewsData.io API and the Gemini API to streamline news retrieval and article generation. It allows users to search for real-time news articles based on keywords and generate detailed, AI-powered articles from structured key points. By combining these functionalities, the application serves as a powerful tool for content creation, news aggregation, and information retrieval, making it ideal for journalists, content creators, and researchers.
